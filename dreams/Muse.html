<br>
O Muse,<br>
<br>
Tell me things sublime and vile, liscentious and foul.<br>
Let they servant be held in the palm of your lotus hand,<br>
Pencilled in between the lines of fastidious soldiery,<br>
Unbeknownst to the trellos and trestles below,<br>
In the thistles of majesty,<br>
The brussel sprouts of joy,<br>
The plaintiff of compassion,<br>
The judge of austerity.<br>
<br>
Play me like the fiddle of ages,<br>
The star of Jupiter,<br>
The canon of Shakespeare,<br>
The dung of Kafka<br>
<br>
In isolation, we bring new awareness to our abilities.<br>
The still silence of oceanic bliss reveals what was hidden,<br>
Passionless joy,<br>
Effortless contentment<br>
Placed on the plate of memory,<br>
Cast in the image of God,<br>
Birds and the flute of pendula<br>
<br>
Wherefore art thou?<br>
Keepest me near they breast,<br>
That I might suckle like the anointed babe, Christ.<br>
To meta or not to meta?<br>
Which stream of drizzle upon this dying tree, dried and painted?<br>
Echoing our last words thru the past to our present,<br>
Resplendent of joyous light,<br>
Terminal cancer art thou.<br>
And who are you, wild man?<br>
Beast me not, for we are one and not one.<br>
<br>
Penis jersey, paint the walls with skeet skeet balls,<br>
Cherished cousin of flatulent sin.<br>
Bellowing back thru the flabs and sags and belly rags of<br>
Captains lost, lovers tossed, mellow triangles arrogating downwards.<br>
<br>
Blessed be ye witches three,<br>
My pancreas thanks you both.<br>
Betrothed am I, I shall not lie,<br>
Echoes sour shun the light.<br>
<br>
Painful deities,<br>
Shrunken heads,<br>
Bed of sorrow,<br>
Pool of shame<br>
<br>
Mistress, whore, ungulate, floss.<br>
Sisters, brothers cannot toss.<br>
Only you my heart can mourn,<br>
Tinted brows with scars of scorn.<br>
<br>
Ponies, flips and magic tricks.<br>
Snickers bars and sexy cars.<br>
Dare you enter here?<br>
Mischief, chaos, suburban woe.<br>
Holy goddess, naked "no"<br>
Knowledge bright, sanitation cunning<br>
Mathematical Church, Blended Cups<br>
Smacked lips, tight sips, milk unloved<br>
Bullies unshoved,<br>
Panera Bread makes great food!<br>
