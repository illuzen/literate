  <body class="poem">
    As I descended<br> 
    I forgot the names of things<br> 
    Colors drained from vision<br>
    I was washed in the river Styx<br> 
    My exoteric desires extinguished<br>
    Exposing a crystal with a chip in it<br> 
    A flaw, very fine and very deep<br>
    Pooling luscious fluids of sexual desire<br> 
    Desire for touch<br> 
    1 wanting 2<br>
    A pulling close<br> 
    A grasping, contracting<br> 
    Tumescent tension<br>

<br>
    I sat in the not-quite-oneness<br>
    The one-birthing-two<br> 
    The aborted birth<br>
    2 appeared and dissolve back into 1<br>
    I mourned the impossibility of companionship for God<br>

<br>
    "<br>
    Can I forget my sockpuppets are mine?<br>
    Are the names for things so fragile?<br>
    "<br>

<br>
    And I realized that I still had control of my body<br> 
    Whatever that is<br> 
    This can not be the end<br>
    Without understanding signs or symbols<br> 
    I moved my body<br>
    This bag of earth and water<br>
    Into the bathtub<br>
    A jacuzzi in which I had dissolved the night before<br>
    Water rushing over my orthogonal pleasure<br>
    Retracing imprints sexual<br>
    Memory released into heaven<br>

<br>
    I turned on the warm water<br>
    Remembered that my body could drown<br>
    Remembered that extreme temperatures could harm it<br>
    Hands beneath the water<br>
    Feel the warmth<br> 
    Plug the tub<br> 
    Lay down<br>
    Amnios rising<br>

<br>
    Water rising to my chin<br>
    Featureless crystal now an egg<br>
    A memory of birth<br>
    A giving of birth<br>
    Disdain for men who wish to cum<br> 
    Who do not understand the consequences<br>
    Sexual power over males<br>
    Lion taming<br>
    Gravity well of sperm<br>
    Out of this void<br>
    This potential<br>
    A tree, a black and golden phallus<br>
    Forged in war and steel<br>
    Fearless son of the Goddess<br>

<br>
    Victory, inevitable Victory<br>
    No one to kill but ourselves Victory<br>
    Meaningless ocean of truth Victory<br>
    Sprouting dream love Victory<br>
    Chaos orders all Victory<br>
    Kill me I dare you Victory<br>
    There is nothing but god Victory<br>
