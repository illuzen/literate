  <body>
    As I descended I forgot the names of things, colors drained from vision<br>
    I was washed in the river Styx, my exoteric desires extinguished,<br>
    exposing a crystal with a chip in it, a flaw, very fine and very deep, in which was<br>
    pooled a luscious flood of sexual desire, desire for touch, 1 wanting 2,<br>
    a pulling close, a grasping, contracting, tumescent tension.<br>

<br>
    I sat in the not-quite-oneness, the one-birthing-two, the aborted birth,<br>
    2 appeared and dissolve back into 1,<br>
    I mourned the impossibility of companionship for God<br>

<br>
    "<br>
    Can I forget my sockpuppets are mine?<br>
    Are the names for things so fragile?<br>
    "<br>

<br>
    And I realized that I still had control of my body, whatever that was, this could not be the end<br>
    Without understanding signs or symbols, I moved my body, this bag of earth and water, into the bathtub,<br>
    a jacuzzi in which I had masturbated the night before,<br>
    water rushing over my nearly orthogonal penis,<br>
    retracing first orgasm,<br>
    memory released into heaven<br>

<br>
    I turned on the warm water,<br>
    remembered that my body could drown,<br>
    remembered that extreme temperatures could harm it,<br>
    hands beneath the water, feel the warmth, plug the tub, lay down,<br>
    amnios rises<br>

<br>
    Water rising to my chin<br>
    Featureless crystal now an egg<br>
    a memory of birth<br>
    a feeling of giving birth<br>
    disdain for men who wish to cum and do not understand the consequences<br>
    sexual power over males<br>
    lion taming<br>
    gravity well of sperm<br>
    and out of this void this potential<br>
    grew a tree<br>
    a black and golden phallus<br>
    forged in war and steel<br>
    fearless son of the goddess<br>

<br>
    Victory, inevitable victory<br>
    No one to kill but ourselves victory<br>
    Meaningless ocean of truth victory<br>
    Sprouting dream love victory<br>
    Chaos orders all victory<br>
    Kill me I dare you victory<br>
    There is nothing but god victory<br>
