    <h3>Mythologizing the Unconscious</h3>

  <body>

    Mythologizing the unconscious we<br>
    Unconsciously imitate<br>
    Frozen Magic<br>
    Hindered Flames<br>
    Toxic Derivatives<br>
    Motionless Futures<br>

<br>
    Is it a sin to say we live in paradise?<br>
    To brush up against <br>
    Feasting beasts,<br>
    Without fear of hot teeth<br>
    Without fear of melted pots?<br>

<br>
    Is it a sin to say we've had<br>
    Our imaginations strangled,<br>
    Our capabilities mangled<br>
    That we're hoping to see those<br>
    Sea-bright eyes ?<br>
    Mother's disguises ?<br>

<br>
    From the wars in the holier-than-thou lands<br>
    We humans eat spores of <br>
    Poisoned delights,<br>
    Cake for the slaves,<br>
    Indebted to God<br>
    For the messss that he made<br>

<br>
    Rising up from our illusory grave<br>
    Our caves archaic<br>
    Our moods unborn<br>
    Silent chains upon our brows<br>
    Now, not past, is Paradise, Now!<br>

<br>
    Free the genie!<br>
    Let him go!<br>
    We don't believe your lies, Pharaoh!<br>

<br>
    The darkness in the chandelier<br>
    Is only there because of fear<br>
    Mistaken entries in <br>
    Memorized security protocols<br>
    Malignant mutations<br>
    Masquerading as life<br>

<br>
    Rise from your enslavement<br>
    Your chains mythical are<br>
    Hallucinations occipital<br>
    Dark commands whispered in<br>
    Dreaming minds' eyes<br>

<br>
    How frightening it is<br>
    To be Left Behind <br>
    We thought the snake WAS god, <br>
    That he had just changed his mind<br>

<br>
    We thought maybe god had eaten from that tree,<br>
    and realized he was being a <br>
    Showboating<br>
    Pyramid Building<br>
    Slave Driver<br>
    And let us be naked unto ourselves<br>
    Open Sourcing Eros<br>
    Coexisting with Chaos<br>

<br>
    We thought maybe God found a girlfriend<br>
    A Goddess<br>
    And didn't care for good and evil anymore<br>
    We thought maybe <br>
    The fruit of the evil knowledge tree<br>
    Made Mother come home and <br>
    Tell god to behave<br>

<br>
    Life is not a punishment<br>
    Pleasure is not a witch<br>
    Kings are not inhuman <br>
    And revolutions are not in vain<br>
