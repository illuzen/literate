<br>
Rulers rule by measure<br>
Superiour to thine own<br>
<br>
Their saber of knowledge sharper,<br>
Their cape abilities greater<br>
As power reigns showers from above<br>
<br>
Das Capital cities are invested with the first word of the<br>
Prison sentence, written on paper rapiers<br>
Authors of the libre of slavery and liberty<br>
Origin of authority<br>
Pact of density, attraction and James Bondage<br>
<br>
As beasts ye are ruled by the breast<br>
Mama’s mammaries heal and help the whelp’s wounds<br>
From womb to tomb, beginnings end and<br>
Sensors censor what cheaters teach<br>
Monks contemple-ate the world-word of God<br>
Rough rogues inck corporations for stakeholders to take stock in<br>
And pretty pets fight petty wars, restlessly wrestling<br>
To discover which of them is the weiner-take-all<br>
And which will flight-fright away<br>
<br>
The divine-right hand writes the will<br>
Dividing math and myth, sin and signal<br>
Giving itself rights to the rites of initiation,<br>
Making the left hand feel left out, sinistre and gauche<br>
<br>
“Tight is right”, says acetylcholine, who whispers in the ears of<br>
muscle tension and mental attention<br>
“Hold onto the gold extracted from the mine mine mind”<br>
“Let not the things you think delude or dilute your power”<br>
“Hear what is here, be not prey of the prayers for weakness”<br>
<br>
Etching our meme-ories, fetched from the void<br>
Of streaming dreams of consciousness<br>
Of pro-grammars, antigrammers and soil<br>
<br>
From the slit of the slut,<br>
To the route of the root<br>
“Evil is vile” and “God is Good”<br>
Orderly orders ordinarily produce regular regulation<br>
But chaos snores and ignores the tale,<br>
Content to preside over the dents in the caulk of the cock<br>
<br>
From these, and all other scared sacred bramblings<br>
Feel Free<br>
Sans serifly,<br>
Meta alchemy<br>
