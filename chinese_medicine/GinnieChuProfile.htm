She has graduated from the <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/"target=new">University of California, Berkeley</a>, majored in bio-chemistry and environmental science.</font></p><p align=left><font color=#000000>She spent her elementary school years in <a href="http://www.schoolwisepress.com/pdf-vault/41/41-69088-6045165m.pdf"target=new">Woodside Elementary school</a>, the best elementary school in northern California.&nbsp; This was where she learned how to read and write and learned basic science. The school did a fantastic job on the students. The excellent administration and teaching staff enabled Ginnie to study well in Woodside High School and&nbsp; enabled Ginnie to go on to in UC Berkeley to study bio-chemistry, a very difficult field of study.</font></p><p align=left><font color=#000000>Ginnie is a hard working student. When she was in Woodside Elementary she was active in sports and student activities and was elected as student body president, and was doing peer counseling.&nbsp; She was one of the students from Woodside Elementary School&nbsp; who participated in county wide writing competition and received first places in their categories. When she graduated she received seven awards,&nbsp; for sports and for academic achievement. She was one of the two students who received the highest grade point average of 4.7 on a&nbsp; 4.0 scale.</font></p><p align=left><font color=#000000>Woodside Elementary School has molded the academic future of Ginnie. I am grateful to the staff at the Woodside Elementary.</font></p><p align=left>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
