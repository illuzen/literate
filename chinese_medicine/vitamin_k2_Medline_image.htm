sustains lumbar bone mineral density in osteoporosis.</font><br>

We attempted to investigate whether vitamin K2 (menatetrenone) treatment 
effectively prevents the incidence of new fractures in osteoporosis. A total of 
241 osteoporotic patients were enrolled in a 24-month randomized open label 
study. The control group (without treatment; n = 121) and the vitamin K2-treated 
group (n = 120), which received 45 mg/day orally vitamin K2, were followed for 
lumbar bone mineral density (LBMD; measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 
[DXA]) and occurrence of new clinical fractures. Serum level of Glu-osteocalcin 
(Glu-OC) and menaquinone-4 levels were measured at the end of the follow-up 
period. Serum level of OC and urinary excretion of deoxypyridinoline (DPD) were 
measured before and after the treatment. The background data of these two groups 
were identical. The incidence of clinical fractures during the 2 years of 
treatment in the control was higher than the vitamin K2-treated group (chi2 = 
10.935; p = 0.0273). The percentages of change from the initial value of LBMD at 
6, 12, and 24 months after the initiation of the study were -1.8 +/- 0.6%, -2.4 
+/- 0.7%, and -3.3 +/- 0.8% for the control group, and 1.4 +/- 0.7%, -0.1 +/- 
0.6%, and -0.5 +/- 1.0% for the vitamin K2-treated group, respectively. The 
changes in LBMD at each time point were significantly different between the 
control and the treated group (p = 0.0010 for 6 months, p = 0.0153 for 12 
months, and p = 0.0339 for 24 months). The serum levels of Glu-OC at the end of 
the observation period in the control and the treated group were 3.0 +/- 0.3 ng/ml 
and 1.6 +/- 0.1 ng/ml, respectively (p &lt; 0.0001), while the serum level of OC 
measured by the conventional radioimmunoassay (RIA) showed a significant rise 
(42.4 +/-6.9% from the basal value) in the treated group at 24 months (18.2 +/- 
6.1% for the controls;p = 0.0081). There was no significant change in urinary 
DPD excretion in the treated group. These findings suggest that vitamin K2 
treatment effectively prevents the occurrence of new fractures, although the 
vitamin K2-treated group failed to increase in LBMD. Furthermore, vitamin K2 
treatment enhances gamma-carboxylation of the OC molecule.<br>
