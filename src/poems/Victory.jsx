              As I descended<br/>
              I forgot the names of things<br/>
              Colors drained from vision<br/>
              I was washed in the river Styx<br/>
              My exoteric desires extinguished<br/>
              A crystal exposed <br/>
              And a crack<br/>
              A flaw<br/>
              Very fine and very deep<br/>
              Pooling luscious fluids of desire<br/>
              Desire for touch<br/>
              Desire for 2<br/>
              A pulling close<br/>
              A grasping, contracting<br/>
              Tumescent tension<br/>

          <br/>
              I lay in the not-quite-oneness<br/>
              The one-birthing-twoness<br/>
              Aborting births of Other<br/>
              She appears and dissolves back into One<br/>
              Each time I mourn the impossibility of companionship for God<br/>

          <br/>
              Can I forget my sockpuppets are mine?<br/>
              Are the names for things so fragile?<br/>

          <br/>
              I still have control of the body<br/>
              Whatever this is<br/>
              It can not be the end<br/>
              Without understanding signs or symbols<br/>
              I move the body<br/>
              This bag of earth and water<br/>
              Into the bathtub<br/>
              A jacuzzi in which I had dissolved the night before<br/>
              Water rushing over my orthogonal pleasure<br/>
              Retracing imprints sexual<br/>
              Memory released into heaven<br/>

          <br/>
              I turned on the warm water<br/>
              Remembered that the body could drown<br/>
              Remembered that extreme temperatures could harm<br/>
              Hands beneath the water<br/>
              Feel the warmth<br/>
              Plug the tub<br/>
              Lay down<br/>
              Amnios rising<br/>

          <br/>
              Rising to my chin<br/>
              Featureless crystal now an egg<br/>
              A memory of birth<br/>
              A giving of birth<br/>
              Disdain for men who wish to cum<br/>
              Without understanding consequence<br/>
              Sexual power over men<br/>
              Lion taming<br/>
              Gravity well of sperm<br/>
              Out of this void this potential<br/>
              A tree a black and golden phallus<br/>
              Forged in war and steel<br/>
              Fearless son of the Goddess<br/>

          <br/>
              Victory, inevitable Victory<br/>
              No one to kill but ourselves Victory<br/>
              Meaningless ocean of truth Victory<br/>
              Sprouting dream love Victory<br/>
              Chaos orders all Victory<br/>
              Kill me I dare you Victory<br/>
              There is nothing but god Victory<br/>
          </div>
