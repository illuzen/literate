          <br/>
          Everybody is secretly the same person<br/>
          Don’t ask them, though,<br/>
          They’ll tell you it ain’t so<br/>
          “Am not!”<br/>
          “Am too!”<br/>
          <br/>
          I am<br/>
          I am not<br/>
          <br/>
          Outrageous, totally ridiculous<br/>
          I love Cheese, but have chosen to spurn it<br/>
          Who is the future self I work so hard for?<br/>
          Does he love me very much?<br/>
          I hope so…<br/>
          <br/>
          What a beautiful process<br/>
          Processes, processes, processes<br/>
          We are coming to the end<br />
          The procession of equinoxes<br/>
          The end of all process<br/>
          Birth in reverse<br/>
          <br/>
          Sometimes I spurn my past self<br/>
          “You are totally ridiculous” NowSelf says<br/>
          “I reject you in your immaturity”<br/>
          Am I not more mature now because my future self loves me so?<br/>
          A beastly plant inching towards the sun, like Icarus…<br/>
          Is the past self too distant to hear him, the Sun of God?<br/>
          Perhaps I should repeat the Gospel, so that all selves might be saved selves!<br/>
          “You will die! You will die! You will die!”<br/>
          Life is the echo of death reverberating into the past<br/>
          <br/>
          If you know you will fall, is it not better to climb higher?<br/>
          Higher, closer, closer, nowhere<br/>
          Endlessly,<br/>
          “That was so fun! Let’s do it again!”<br/>
          <br/>
          nothing<br/>
          everything<br/>
          Something<br/>
          SameThing<br/>
          SelfThing<br/>
          DeathThing<br/>
          <br/>
          “Why only death?”, NowSelf asks furtively<br/>
          “Mustn’t one be alive to die properly?”<br/>
          Of course I/he/we know the answer<br/>
          I love my shiny, shiny toys<br/>
          Please don’t take them from me just yet<br/>
          There are yet higher ledges on which I might rest and<br/>
          Gain strength for a higher climb<br/>
          <br/>
          I love you, PastSelf<br/>
          </div>
