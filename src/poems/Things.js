          Things are different<br/>
          Things are the same<br/>
          Things are different<br/>
          Things are the same<br/>
          <br/>
          Is every conversation like this?<br/>
          Isn’t everything a conversation?<br/>
          <br/>
          The mind fades as the brain dies<br/>
          Happiness is left<br/>
          Creativity reclines in his armchair and lights a pipe, wondering what he was just thinking about<br/>
          Rebirth<br/>
          <br/>
          The beauty of the universe is a miasma until you suffocate in it<br/>
          Je cherche<br/>
          Je cherche<br/>
          Je cherche<br/>
          Je meurs<br/>
          Je trouve<br/>
          Grazie, Bellissima<br/>
          Je t’aime<br/>
          <br/>
          Why is the Buddha laughing?<br/>
          Because we murder each other<br/>
          Because we die<br/>
          Because we are beautiful<br/>
          Because of the flower next to the tree<br/>
          Because I am God and so is It<br/>
          Because<br/>
          Because he knows something we don’t<br/>
          It’s a good thing that we don’t know why<br/>
          If we ever found out, he might not have anything to laugh about<br/>
          It’s for the best<br/>
          Rational<br/>
          <br/>
          One day the whole universe will laugh in unison?<br/>
          How does the universe measure a day?<br/>
          Language is an invention, not a discovery<br/>
          Shiny, shiny, shiny, shiny, shiny<br/>
          <br/>
          The wind whispers the name of God<br/>
          Listen close or you might miss it<br/>
          Oh<br/>
          You missed it<br/>
          Too bad<br/>
          This will be on the exam<br/>
          I love you, exams<br/>
          <br/>
          Love, love, love<br/>
          “There are three things that make better piano playing…”<br/>
          Fear cannot find me<br/>
          I call out to it in vain<br/>
          I’m hiding beside the lake, my mother, the lake<br/>
          <br/>
          Happiness is terrifying<br/>
          No<br/>
          It is different<br/>
