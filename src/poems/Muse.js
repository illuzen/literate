          <br/>O Muse<br/>
          <br/>
          Tell me things sublime and vile, liscentious and foul<br/>
          Let thy servant be held in the palm of your lotus hand<br/>
          Pencilled in between the lines of fastidious soldiery<br/>
          Unbeknownst to the trellos and trestles below<br/>
          In the thistles of majesty<br/>
          The brussel sprouts of joy<br/>
          The plaintiff of compassion<br/>
          The judge of austerity<br/>
          <br/>
          Play me like the fiddle of ages<br/>
          The star of Jupiter<br/>
          The canon of Shakespeare<br/>
          The dung of Kafka<br/>
          <br/>
          In isolation, we bring new awareness to our abilities<br/>
          The still silence of oceanic bliss reveals what was hidden<br/>
          Passionless joy<br/>
          Effortless contentment<br/>
          Placed on the plate of memory<br/>
          Cast in the image of God<br/>
          Birds and the flute of pendula<br/>
          <br/>
          Wherefore art thou?<br/>
          Keepest me near they breast<br/>
          That I might suckle like the anointed babe, Christ<br/>
          <br/>
          To meta or not to meta?<br/>
          Which stream of drizzle upon this dying tree, dried and painted?<br/>
          Echoing our last words thru the past to our present<br/>
          Resplendent of joyous light<br/>
          Terminal cancer art thou<br/>
          And who are you, wild man?<br/>
          Beast me not, for we are one and not one<br/>
          <br/>
          Penis jersey, paint the walls with skeet skeet balls<br/>
          Cherished cousin of flatulent sin<br/>
          Bellowing back thru the flabs and sags and belly rags of<br/>
          Captains lost, lovers tossed, mellow triangles arrogating downwards<br/>
          <br/>
          Blessed be ye witches three<br/>
          My pancreas thanks you both<br/>
          Betrothed am I, I shall not lie<br/>
          Echoes sour shun the light<br/>
          <br/>
          Painful deities<br/>
          Shrunken heads<br/>
          Bed of sorrow<br/>
          Pool of shame<br/>
          <br/>
          Mistress, whore, ungulate, floss<br/>
          Sisters, brothers carelessly tossed<br/>
          Only you my heart can mourn<br/>
          Tinted brows with scars of scorn<br/>
          <br/>
          Ponies, flips and magic tricks<br/>
          Snickers bars and sexy cars<br/>
          Dare you enter here?<br/>
          <br/>
          Mischief, chaos, suburban woe<br/>
          Holy goddess, naked "no"<br/>
          Knowledge bright, sanitation cunning<br/>
          Mathematical Church, Blended Cups<br/>
          Smacked lips, tight sips, milk unloved<br/>
          Bullies unshoved<br/>
          <br/>
          Panera Bread makes great food!<br/>
